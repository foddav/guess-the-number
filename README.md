# Guess the Number - CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker & Kubernetes

This project is a **simple React application** ("Guess the Number" game) wrapped into a **professional DevOps workflow**.  
It demonstrates how to containerize an app with Docker, deploy it to an AWS Cluster with Kubernetes, and automate the process with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
This project was created as part of my DevOps learning journey and portfolio.

## üéÆ About the Game  
"Guess the Number" is a simple React-based game where the user tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer.  
There are three difficulty levels and three types of hints available.  
The goal is to guess the correct number before running out of attempts or points, while the game guides you by telling if your guess is higher or lower than the target.

## üìå Project Goals  
- Show a **production-style pipeline** setup with:  
  - containerization  
  - deployment & service management  
  - CI/CD automation  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  
- **React (Vite)** ‚Äì simple frontend app  
- **Docker** ‚Äì build container image  
- **Nginx** ‚Äì serve the built static files  
- **Docker-compose** - testing the game locally  
- **Kubernetes** ‚Äì run the app in a cluster (Deployment + Service)  
- **Jenkins** ‚Äì automate build, push, and deploy pipeline  
- **Terraform** - provide a simple infrastructure on AWS for testing the process

---

## üìù How It Works
1. **GitHub Repository**  
   - Stores application source code and infrastructure files (`Dockerfile`, `kubernetes/`, `Jenkinsfile`).

2. **Docker**  
   - Builds an image that contains the React app bundled with Nginx.

3. **Kubernetes**  
   - Runs the app as a `Deployment` with a `Service` (type: LoadBalancer) to expose it.

4. **Jenkins (CI/CD pipeline)**  
   - Watches the GitHub repo (via webhook).  
   - On each `git push`:  
     - Builds a new Docker image.  
     - Pushes it to DockerHub.  
     - Updates the Kubernetes deployment automatically.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Test the Game (Docker Compose)  
You can test the game without Jenkins or Kubernetes:  
```
cd application  
docker compose up --build  
```  
Open http://localhost:8080

## üöÄ Deployment process & CI/CD (short guide)  
This project includes a complete CI/CD flow: Jenkins builds a Docker image, pushes it to DockerHub, then deploys the image to a Kubernetes cluster. You can either provision an example AWS/EKS cluster with the included Terraform or deploy to your own existing cluster.

Note: This repository **does not include a Jenkins server image**. Start Jenkins however you prefer (local Docker, cloud VM, etc.).  

### Steps  
First, you need to have **Docker Hub username and password**, and you need to create a new Docker Hub repository named `guess-the-number`.  
  
I provided an example AWS terraform infrastructure, but if you already have an existing one, skip the first step.  

### 1. make a new AWS Cluster with terraform (if you already have one, skip this step)  
```
cd infrastructure_example/terraform  
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```  
This will create infrastructure on AWS: a VPC with subnets, and an EKS cluster with nodes.
You need to wait until it is done and fully set up.  
  
### 2. update kubeconfig for your workstation and check the current-context  
```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster-name>  
kubectl config current-context  
```  
  
### 3. copy kubeconfig for Jenkins and add it as a Jenkins Secret file  
```
cp ~/.kube/config ~/configfile  
```  
add new credential on Jenkins:  
- kind: secretfile  
- file: ~/configfile  
- id: kubeconfig  
  
### 4. add AWS Access and Secret keys to Jenkins  
  
add new credential on Jenkins:  
- kind: Username with Password  
- Username: AWS_ACCES_KEY  
- Password: AWS_SECRET_KEY  
- id: aws-creds  
  
### 5. add your DockerHub credentials to Jenkins  
  
add new credential on Jenkins:  
- kind: Username with Password  
- Username: your-dockerhub-username  
- Password: your-dockerhub-password  
- id: dockerhub-creds  
  
### 6. create a new pipeline  
  
create a new pipeline item:  
- New Item ‚Üí Pipeline  
- Definition: Pipeline script from SCM ‚Üí Git  
- Repository: https://github.com/(your-user)/guess-the-number.git  
- Branch: */main (or your branch)  
- Script Path: Jenkinsfile  
  
(Note: if you run Jenkins in a way that it has a publicly accessible address, you can add that URL as a webhook to the GitHub repository and thus automate the deployment after pushes.)  

### 7. run the pipeline  
Build Now on Jenkins --> wait until success  

### 8. check the app in browser  
```
kubectl get svc number-guesser  
```  
find the EXTERNAL-IP on terminal and open it in browser  
  
### 9. CI/CD test (with webhook automatisation)  
if you have a webhook on the GitHub repository, you can make new commits with some changes in code, and after push the new deployment will be automatically done  
  
### 10. cleanup (delete cluster, if you used the Terraform example)  
```
cd infrastructure_example/terraform  
terraform destroy  
```

## Short notes  
- The kubernetes/deployment.yaml contains a placeholder ${DOCKER_IMAGE}. The pipeline uses envsubst to replace it with the real image name before applying the manifest.  
- Keep your credentials (kubeconfig, DockerHub, AWS keys) out of the repo ‚Äî they must be uploaded to Jenkins as credentials.
