# Guess the Number - CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker & Kubernetes

This project is a **simple React application** ("Guess the Number" game) wrapped into a **professional DevOps workflow**.  
It demonstrates how to containerize an app with Docker, deploy it on Kubernetes, and automate the process with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
This project was created as part of my DevOps learning journey and portfolio.

## 🎮 About the Game
"Guess the Number" is a simple React-based game where the user tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer.  
There are three difficulty levels and three types of hints available.  
The goal is to guess the correct number before running out of attempts or points, while the game guides you by telling if your guess is higher or lower than the target.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Show a **production-style pipeline** setup.  
- Demonstrate knowledge of:
  - **Docker** (containerization)  
  - **Kubernetes** (deployment & service management)  
  - **Jenkins** (CI/CD automation)  
---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **React (Vite)** – simple frontend app  
- **Docker** – build container image  
- **Nginx** – serve the built static files  
- **Kubernetes** – run the app in a cluster (Deployment + Service)  
- **Jenkins** – automate build, push, and deploy pipeline

## 📝 How It Works
1. **GitHub Repository**  
   - Stores application source code and infrastructure files (`Dockerfile`, `kubernetes/`, `Jenkinsfile`).

2. **Docker**  
   - Builds an image that contains the React app bundled with Nginx.

3. **Kubernetes**  
   - Runs the app as a `Deployment` with a `Service` (type: LoadBalancer) to expose it.

4. **Jenkins (CI/CD pipeline)**  
   - Watches the GitHub repo (via webhook).  
   - On each `git push`:  
     - Builds a new Docker image.  
     - Pushes it to DockerHub.  
     - Updates the Kubernetes deployment automatically.

## ▶️ Test the Game (Docker Compose)
You can test the game without Jenkins or Kubernetes:

1. docker compose up --build
2. Open http://localhost:8080
